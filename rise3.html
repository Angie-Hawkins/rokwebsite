    <H3>My own personal view of Rise of Kingdoms </H3>
    <p>I have been playing the game for 3 years and in thses 3 years.I have created an alliance -NBD1- all the players there have grown to know each other and formed a bond , we have as a team have worked together helping each other upgrade our accounts ,gone into civil wars,fought in many K.V.K's. we have migrated to differnt kingdoms as a group of players but still stayed together.
        we are a "ROK FAMILY" 
        to be apart of a group of players from all walks of life,from all over the world we have for the past 3 years stuck together. I have found that no matter the distance friendships remain.</p>
